# Number-Guessing-Game-
this is my second coding project

#How it works
1. The message appears, "Guess the Number from {Start} to {Finish}: ", obviously it doesnt actually say {start} and {finsh} but instead it shows the number you set {start} as, so for this project I chose 1, and for {finish} I chose 10.
2. If you get the number incorrect, it will show the message "Incorrect, try again!" and it will keep on looping until you get the correct answer in which then it will show you the message "Correct!"
3. Once the game finishes, it will show you the number of attempts it took for you to get the correct answer then show you a message telling you if you want to play again or not. 

That's all! If you read all of this, I just wanna say I love you <3
