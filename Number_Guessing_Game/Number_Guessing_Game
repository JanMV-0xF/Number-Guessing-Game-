- I want the user to guess a number from {START} to {FINISH} randomly
- use the random library
- keep looping until user gets the correct answer
- track the # of attempts of the user before getting the correct answer and print it to the user
- problem: # of attempts continues to the next match and counts the previous match
- proposed solution:
    - count the # of attempts in current match then after the user gets the correct answer, print # of attempts. if user wants another match, reset everything and load a new game
